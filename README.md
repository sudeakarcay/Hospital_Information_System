# Hospital_Information_System
This project was written in Java using Eclipse IDE based on the appointment system in hospitals. Patients who want to make an appointment can choose the city they 
are in through the system, and make an appointment with the department and doctor they want. During the appointment process, patients can choose the additional 
procedures they want to have if they wish. After making an appointment, they have the right to cancel the appointment. In addition, after 
making an appointment, they can review the appointment and doctor information on the system. The system also gives patients the right to view 
the results of procedures such as MRIs and X-rays taken at the hospital. Other people who contributed to the project: Merve Åžahin and Reyhan Suna Kul
